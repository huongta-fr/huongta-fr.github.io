            <p> <strong>Warehouse Management System (WMS) with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) </strong>: Led end-to-end development of a complex warehouse automation solution combining a Warehouse Management System (WMS) with autonomous AGVs. The platform automates classification, storage and picking workflows: users scan a QR code, perform minimal UI steps, and the system locates the optimal shelf, directs AGVs to retrieve and return storage units, and orchestrates inbound/outbound operations.</p>
